Four-step tutorial and code: How to paste 4 images into 1 image ? but for many images at once ! from Google Drive folder.

Did you have 400 photos you wanted to print? 
But instead of 400 photos, you wanted about 100 with 4 images in each printed image?

It happened to me after a trip to the east two years ago, when I wanted to make a notebook with pictures and experiences.
But I didn't find any place that prepares these many collages at once.

My ex had an idea: write it in Python.
And for a young computer science student it was a fun and easy challenge (some Google searches and code organization).

And so this short guide was created for you, enjoy
Write me if it was helpful :)
